# Yahoo! Europe's web development code test

In 2006, I joined Yahoo! Europe as a web developer. At that time, they
(ultimately, we) had a coding exercise I often find myself referring
back to. I'm reproducing it here, for future reference.

## Exercise instructions

The candidate (who, by this stage, had passed a simple phone exercise)
was sent the [Yahoo! HotJobs homepage mock](hotjobsmock.png) and the
following instructions to complete in their own time:

> Attached is an old version of the Hotjobs homepage that we use for this
> exercise. We would like you to complete the following 2 tasks:
> 
> 1. Please mark-up and style the attached graphical mock-up.
> 
> 2. Please add some JavaScript to validate the text entered into the
> email address field on the page. Should the email address be invalid,
> use the DOM to add a message to the user on the page.
> 
> 3. Browser Support:  Aim to have the page styling and functionality
> according to specification on as many of the following as you have
> access to:
> 
> - Firefox 1.5/Win
> - IE5.5/Win
> - IE6/Win
> - Opera 8.5/Win
> - Safari 2.0/Mac
> 
> We are looking for web standards code and techniques. Think about
> accessibility and separating the mark-up, presentation and behaviour
> layers.
> 
> Obviously a graphical mockup is not an adequate specification, so you
> will have to make some assumptions during development. Please feel
> free to do so, but note them down and let me know in your response.
> 
> Our web sever will most likely reject a zip file from you, so please
> post your work online somewhere, perhaps on your personal site.

## My solution

My solution—not *the* solution, just the one I submitted when I applied
to Yahoo! in late 2006—is included in this repository. I have no idea
how well regarded it was among the team reviewing it, save that I moved
on to the next stage of interview.

There are also many, many things about it that I'd do differently now,
and probably many that I'd have done differently a few months after
starting at Yahoo!.
